    <!-- Artist Statement -->
    <div class="artist-statement">
      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>My work explores the intersection between the natural world and human experience. I am fascinated by how we perceive and interact with our environment, and how these interactions shape our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.</p>
      <p>Through my paintings, I seek to capture moments of connection and revelation—those fleeting instances when the ordinary becomes extraordinary. I am drawn to the tension between representation and abstraction, between what is seen and what is felt.</p>
      <p>Color plays a crucial role in my practice, serving as both an emotional catalyst and a structural element. I use layering techniques to create depth and complexity, inviting viewers to look beyond the surface and discover new perspectives with each viewing.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, my aim is to create work that resonates on multiple levels—visually stimulating, emotionally evocative, and intellectually engaging. I hope to inspire viewers to see the world around them with fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder.</p>
